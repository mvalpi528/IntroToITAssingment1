					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am a student studying IT at RMIT university and also work as a professional musician and music educator. I am Australian and my cultral background is Italian/Irish. In my spare time I love getting outdoors and try to spend as much time as possible surfing or swimming.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						My interest in IT has two distinct chapters. When I was in primary school my dad worked in IT, so as early as the late 90’s my family had two desktop computers at home. At this time I was obsessed with gaming and would try to spend all of my spare time at the computer until forcibly removed and I can remember one of my earliest career ambitions was to become a game developer. However, in my early teens music became my sole focus and I eventually trained to become a professional musician, the field I currently work in.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second chapter of my IT journey started when I began to look for new career opportunities that would be both intellectually challenging and present opportunities for long term career development. My housemate at the time (another musician) had gone back to university to study science had completed a number of programming subjects and suggested that I try programming. Although a little reluctant at first, I began some self study of Python and Javascript through Codecademy. After a few months of self study I decided to make the jump back into tertiary study to follow a more structured program and receive a recognised qualification at the end of my studies.
					</p>

					<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience</h3>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						In addition to the friend who encouraged me to learn programming, another friend of mine managed a small tech start-up and spoke positively about the field. Another factor that made me consider IT is the extent to which my industry is being revolutionised by advances in IT and software. Applications such as Spotify and Ableton have transformed the way people listen to and produce music and it seems as though many of the exciting roles in the field appear to be in technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						My experience in the field is still limited, having completed roughly 9 months of self study as well as one semester at another university. In this time I have had some exposure to Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML and CSS.
					</p>

					<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						My choice to come to RMIT initially stemmed from my dissatisfaction with my previous university. I had decided to enrol in a Bachelor of Computer Science at another university, completing one semester and beginning a second. In this time I was very unhappy with content and delivery, which was essentially rote learning from textbooks that appeared to be quite outdated.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I am only able to study online due to my current work commitments, the number of potential universities is quite small. I had not initially considered RMIT as the degree title was ‘Information Technology’ as opposed to ‘Computer Science’, which I thought may be less relevant to my aspirations as a developer. However in RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology degree there seems to be a significant number of  programming subjects. Another positive aspect of the RMIT degree is its reputation and industry focus which is important to me as someone who is studying in order to change careers and want to be job ready as quickly as possible.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What do you expect to learn during your studies?
					</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						I expect to learn enough programming and professional practice skills to be a competitive applicant for junior developer jobs upon graduation. I also expect to learn about a number of other subfields within IT that I’m not yet familiar with and may have an interest in or aptitude for.

					<h2>Senior Full-Stack Engineer - Content platform (Remote Eligible)</h2>
					<p></p>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>The position is a full stack developer role in Spotify’s content platform engineering organisation. This ad mentions web development and related technologies, which from what I can understand suggests that you will be working on Spotify’s web browser player as opposed to its mobile app. </p>
					<p>This position is appealing for a number of reasons; firstly Spotify is a product I use frequently and enjoy. Secondly, at this point in my IT training, 'full stack developer’ seems like an appealing position as you have a role in developing the full product and will gain broader understanding of how something works as a whole. Thirdly, the position is advertised as a remote friendly position. Remote work is very appealing to me as it removes the need to commute and may open up to opportunities for travel and flexibility while working. </p>
					<h2>Skills I have</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>At this point in my training my skills and qualifications are very limited having done a small amount of self study in Javascript, one subject in Python at another university and now two weeks of Java. However, my Graduate Diploma in Commerce may prove useful if I ever work in a business intelligence or in a management role within IT.</p>
					<h2>Skills I Need</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>While the position is advertising for a full-stack developer, it seems to be slightly more oriented towards front-end technologies. Spotify is looking for a candidate that is experienced in JavaScript and React. Whereas for the backend requirements they wanted ‘some experience’ in ‘either’ Java or C++. The ad also states that the candidate needs to be proficient in the agile development methodology. </p>
					<h2>Learning Plan</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>The degree plan for the Bachelor of IT at RMIT seems to me as though the degree is focused on backend technologies, with the programming courses being delivered in Java, C and C++. This means that I will need to learn frontend skills such as JavaScript and React in my own time. I have already spent some time working through exercises on Udemy, Codecademy and Free Code Camp, although I am sceptical that these websites are able to get me up to the required professional standard. Another learning strategy that I have considered is building clone websites/web applications and studying the code available in public github repositories. </p>
					<p>As the question states that this plan may change significantly over time, I’d like to add that I’m open to many career paths within IT, although at this point I have a preference for development fields over paths such as networking and cyber security. </p>

				<article>
					<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>In general I am fairly skeptical of personality profile questionnaires, especially online administered ones. Much like horoscopes, the descriptions of each personality type are often vague enough that it is easy to find aspects of your personality in the descriptions of many different types. Additionally, the use of a one to five scale that asks users to either agree or disagree with a statement can easily be interpreted in a number of different ways. An example of this would be a test that asks you to agree or disagree with a statement of ‘whether you generally keep your room tidy’. Presumably, people have very different ideas about what constitutes a clean room and someone might strongly agree with that statement, although their idea of what a clean room is different to someone who is extremely orderly who might state that they don’t ‘strongly agree’ as they forgot to vacuum behind the cabinets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the scepticism I have expressed in the above paragraph, I do think these tests give me a degree of insight into my personality and working style. Another consideration that may make my ‘type’ less informative is that two of the indicators in my Myers-Briggs assessment were very close to 50%, meaning that I could have easily been put into a completely different ‘type’ had a small number of my responses been slightly different.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the more interesting aspects of the Myers-Briggs assessment was that it provided an extra letter to describe whether you were turbulent or assertive. Assertiveness was one of two indicators that were more definitive as I was assessed as being 82% assertive. I thought this result was fairly indicative of my personality and working style. When working I like clarity, structure and procedure and find it stressful to work with turbulent people who may have a haphazard approach to projects.
					</p>
					<h2>
						How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
					</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						A potential influence that these results would have on my behaviour within a team is the added self-awareness that they provide. Heightened self awareness may allow you to catch when you are behaving in a way that is detrimental to the team and give insight as to why this may be the case. For example, an aspect of the INTJ type is that they are likely to be dismissive of other people's ideas as they see themselves as the ‘mastermind’ and ‘strategist’. This mindset is likely to be toxic to teamwork, especially if combined with others who might also want to assume a leadership role, as they may also be having dismissive thoughts about my ideas.
					</p>
					<h2>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						To effectively take into account the results of these tests it would be necessary to know the personality types of other prospective team members. This information is necessary to anticipate how different types may interact and how each type may compliment or hinder another. When considering potential group members it would be an asset for your team members to score highly on agreeableness and conscientiousness, which would likely result in high group output along with low interpersonal conflict.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>The project that I would like to undertake is the creation of an iOS application that assists music students with applying the principles of ‘deliberate practice’ to their music practice at home. ‘Deliberate practice’ as described by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool in their book Peak (reference)  is a way of practicing that is focused and effortful, incorporating external feedback to inform appropriate adjustments to a student’s technique and output. </p>
					<p>As deliberate practice requires feedback, it is necessary for the application to be ‘smart’. In this context I am using the word ‘smart’ to refer to the ability to accept and analyse user inputs in order to generate and display useful feedback to the student. </p>
					<p>In much the same way as a music teacher is able to give feedback, the application should be able to listen to a student’s performance and give appropriate and specific feedback across a number of areas, such as pitch, rhythm and tuning. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>Many music students struggle to practice effectively without the direct guidance of a teacher. As the majority of students' time practicing their musical instrument is without the guidance of a teacher, there is a large opportunity to improve in the quality of this practice time, leading to significant improvements in educational outcomes for students.</p>
					<p>Other broader trends that suggest a use case for this technology is the fact that instrumental music programs continue to be popular in Australian schools and that children routinely use iPads for classroom learning.</p>
					<p>There are many adults that are turning toward technology to learn music and as a result a number of technological solutions have emerged to support independent music learning, especially of instruments such as guitar and piano. However, many of these apps only show a student what to play, not necessarily how to practice for maximum results.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Parental lock</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>A major concern with leaving young students alone with iPads is that they will be tempted to use the iPads to play games or watch videos. A solution for this would be to create a parental lock feature that would not allow the student to access other apps for a given amount of time or until a parent enters a password, stopping students from exiting the app and playing games during their practice time. </p>
					<h3>Metronome</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>The metronome is a vital practice tool that plays a ‘click’ sound at regular intervals to help musicians practice keeping a steady pulse. This tool already exists in a variety of digital forms and could be feasibly integrated as a feature in a broader application.</p>
					<h3>Tuner</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Integrating a tuner will help students tune their instruments without the help of a teacher. Tuners can also be used to practice creating and sustaining a given pitch on instruments that don't have frets or keys. Many sophisticated digital tuners already exist in the marketplace with some including detailed analysis modes that can give you an accuracy percentage. </p>
					<h3>Display sheet music + MIDI playback</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Many music notation and creation programs use the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format. This format uses digital inputs to trigger audio samples or software instruments, giving the impression of a musical performance. Integration of MIDI functionality into the application will allow the app to demonstrate how a particular piece or section of music should sound. </p>
					<p>Another option that may be slightly less realistic is the idea of syncing audio to pdf sheet music and superimposing a playback marker that shows where the audio syncs to the sheet music. However, I’m not sure how technically feasible this is as it is important that the audio can be sped up and slowed down to match the students current maximum performance speed. </p>
					<h3>Audio analysis</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>I expect that this will be the most difficult aspect of the project to implement. Although software that can analyse audio already exists, I can imagine it would be incredibly difficult to create a program that can make sense of audio and give appropriate recommendations to correct student mistakes. </p>
					<h3>Practice timer/log</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>This feature will record and log the amount of time spent in the app, keeping track of the amount of time the student has spent practicing. This is useful for teachers, students and parents alike who would all have a vested interest in making sure that the student practices regularly. This can create a sense of pride and accountability for students who will see their total hours increase over time. </p>
					<h3>Badges and social proof</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>This would bring an element of gamification to the app. Gamification is a frequently used strategy to increase user engagement and often involves fostering a sense of achievement by guiding a user to complete discrete challenges or pass certain milestones. Gamification is often implemented by creating levels that a user can advance through or by presenting the user with badges or awards. In this case, badges are likely to be the more relevant way of gamifying this particular app. An example of this may be awarding the user a badge for ‘100 hours of practice’ or ‘7 days in a row’ of practice. These could be displayed on the students profile as a means of social proof and a way for students to showcase their accomplishments. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>As iOS apps are created in XCode, a macOS application, a Macintosh computer will be required to write the code. Although XCode is able to test your code using virtual devices, it would also be prudent to test the app on a variety of iPads and iPhones to the real end user experience. Another reason for using real devices as opposed to a simulation is to test the functionality that requires the devices microphone and speakers.</p>
					<p>The application will also require some kind of remote storage for user data. The data that will need to be stored includes the users sheet music and audio files as well as user metadata such as the number of times they have logged in and how much time they have spent in the app. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<p>Programming in Swift and or Objective C. These are the primary languages for iOS development and will be required to create an iOS app.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Reading sheet music and other basic music literacy concepts. This is vital to assess whether the application actually works and achieves its desired result.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>How to navigate and use iOS devices. This seems like it would be assumed knowledge, but it is necessary to be able to test the product.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Creating effective databases and managing cloud storage. This is necessary to ensure that user data is stored in a secure and cost effective way. </p>
						<p></p>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The desired outcome of this project is that students will not only practice more effectively, but also that they will become more likely to practice through the use of gamification and other psychological principles that encourage repeated and sustained usage. </p>
					<p>Through more frequent and higher quality practice students will progress faster at their given instrument. Success in any field makes participants more likely to continue as a result of their feelings of mastery and satisfaction at completing difficult tasks with skill. Hopeful these factors will all combine to create more confident and capable musicians.</p>
